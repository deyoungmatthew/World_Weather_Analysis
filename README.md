# World_Weather_Analysis

# **Purpose**
The purpose was to familiarize myself with API pulls from various sources.  Weather, hotel, and city data were pulled to eventually create a hotel search and itinerary.

## **Challenges**
I had extensive challenges getting the Google API to work, primarily with having to create multiple API keys and activating multiple APIs to eventually get the pulls to work.  The two pretty maps below were eventually created:

## Results
I would love to learn more about APIs, but I need a break from them.  My brain hurts and I'm tired.
